# MilitaryObjectDetection

## Data (Data files were too large to include in this repo)
1. Military Aircraft Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/a2015003713/militaryaircraftdetectiondataset)
   
   a. This dataset contains images for 43 different types of military aircrafts from a variety of angles and locations. This includes bounding given in PASCAL VOC format to identify where the objects lie within each image. These images are sourced from google. This image dataset meets our requirements because it contains images containing military aircraft. Moreover, we will be doing substantial augmentation to expand this dataset. In total there are 19746 images in the dataset spread across 43 different classes. This distribution of images by class is given in the image below.
